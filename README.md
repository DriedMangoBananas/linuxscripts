# linuxscripts
 My linux scripts/ config files

For shell scripts, first chmod +x and move to /bin to use as standalone terminal commands.

sysinfo: Memory, IPs and system temp all in the same place at last.

sshvpn: A workable attempt to use vpn over ssh using sshuttle and my VPS to bypass streaming service region blocking. This uses password authentication to avoid using ssh keys. This may still leak DNS requests so don't use for anything critical.
